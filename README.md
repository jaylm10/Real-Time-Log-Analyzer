# Log Analyzer and Threat Detection System 🚀

## Overview
The **Log Analyzer and Threat Detection System** is a real-time tool designed to monitor and analyze system logs for potential threats and anomalies. By leveraging advanced parsing techniques and AI-based anomaly detection, this tool ensures that critical events are flagged and mitigated promptly.

## Features 🛠️
- **Real-time Log Monitoring**: Ingests and processes logs from various sources in real-time.
- **Threat Detection**: Identifies potential security threats like unauthorized access attempts, suspicious IPs, and abnormal activities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning to detect deviations from normal patterns.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Configure alerts for specific log events or detected threats.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes data for better understanding and management.
- **Scalability**: Handles high volumes of log data efficiently.

## Tech Stack 🧰
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: Elasticsearch
- **Visualization**: Kibana
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow/PyTorch/IsolationForest (for threat detection and anomaly detection models)
- **Deployment**: Docker (Planned)

## Architecture 📐
- **Log Ingestion**: Collects logs from applications, servers, and other sources.
- **Processing Pipeline**: Analyzes logs, detects anomalies, and stores results in Elasticsearch.
- **Alerting System**: Sends notifications based on predefined criteria.
- **Visualization**: Displays log data and insights via Kibana.
